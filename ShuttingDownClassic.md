### How to Shut Down Classic for the Entire Organization:

#### [Make Lightning Experience the Only Experience](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=lex_enable_users_disable_switcher.htm&type=5)
Ready for your users to go all in on Lightning Experience? Keep them in Lightning Experience by hiding the option to switch back to Salesforce Classic, for your whole org or for some of your users.

REQUIRED EDITIONS
Available in: Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions
The org-wide setting Make Lightning Experience your org's only experience isn’t available in Group Editions.
When you enable Lightning Experience, users with the Lightning Experience User permission automatically get the Switcher. The Switcher lets users move back and forth between the new and classic Salesforce interfaces. But you can remove the Switcher, for some or all of your users.

#### To remove for some users:

From Setup, enable the Hide Option to Switch to Salesforce Classic permission in profiles and permission sets.

Hide Option to Switch to Salesforce Classic permission in profiles and permission sets

#### To remove for the entire org:

From Setup in Salesforce Classic, click Get Started in the Lightning Experience Transition Assistant tile at the top of the menu. From Setup in Lightning Experience, enter Lightning in the Quick Find box, then select Lightning Experience Transition Assistant.
Select the Optimize phase.
Click Motivate Users to Work in Lightning Experience to expand the stage.
Turn on Make Lightning Experience your org’s only experience.
If your org doesn’t contain custom profiles, you can’t use this setting. Use the Hide Option to Switch to Salesforce Classic permission instead.

You can use Make Lightning Experience your org's only experience or use the permission set; however, you can’t use both to hide the Switcher. When you enable, users see Lightning Experience the next time they log in to Salesforce. And they no longer see the Switch to Salesforce Classic link.
